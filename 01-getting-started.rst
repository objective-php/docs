==================================
Getting started with Objective PHP
==================================

Pre-requisites
""""""""""""""

The most important pre-requisite needed to use Objective PHP is PHP7.

If you don't have it installed yet, please take a look at `Official PHP website <http://www.php.net>`_ and read instruction about PHP7 installation on your development machine.


Installation
""""""""""""

The easiest way to start a project with Objective PHP is to use composer's "create-project" feature and get the Objective PHP Starter Kit:

The following command assumes composer is available in your current PATH:

:: 

    composer create-project -s dev objective-php/starter-kit op-quick-start

Where *op-quick-start* should be replaced with anything matching your actual project name.

Starting a server
"""""""""""""""""

To quickly run and access the starter application, you can use the internal PHP HTTP server. The easiest way for that being launching the provided serve.sh script:

::
   
   cd op-quick-start
   ./server.sh [-p PORT=8080]

Or you can launch it manually:

::
    
    cd op-quick-start
    php -S localhost:8080 -t public

That's it! If everything went fine, you should be able to point a browser to http://localhost:8080 and access the starter kit home page.

Repositories
""""""""""""

While the ``objective-php/starter-kit`` repository is the easiest way to get started with Objective PHP, all repositories can be
accessed and fetched on the project `organization page <http://github.com/objective-php>`_.
